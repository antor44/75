# Seven and a half
Seven and a half is a free MSX Basic game, developed with default Basic, in text mode (SCREEN 0) and without inserting machine code.

How to play: This card game uses packs of 40 cards. Players play against the dealer. On each player's turn they may ask for extra cards to improve their card total. The final card remains face-down.

Card Values: Aces=1 point, 1-7=Face value, Picture Cards: 1/2 point. In this   video game the three picture cards are Jack, Queen and King (4 decks).

If the cards exceed 7.5 points, they have gone bust, show their cards and loss the hand. If the cards are exactly 7.5 points, players show their hand, their turn is finished and they will most likely win, unless the dealer has too 7.5. If a dealer goes bust, then the other player that hasn't gone bust wins. If a single player scores 7.5 points, they win and control the dealer on the next hand.
